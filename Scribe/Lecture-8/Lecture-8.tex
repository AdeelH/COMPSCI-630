\section{Lecture Summary}

Synchronization
D-Threads
THE system design

\section{Synchronization}
Non-determinism is the behaviour when the result of each run of a program is different. Eg:
 If there are 2 threads t1 and t2 such that:

	t1			t2
      a = 1		      a = 2

and if a is global, the o/p can be 1 or 2

Now,

	t1			t2
  			      a = 2
				.
    	a = 1			.
				.(after lapse of a day)
			   print a

The results would be 1 or undefined in the case of C/C++ because C/C++ will get the value from "thin air".
Access from RAM is in chunks of memory called cachelines. Protocol MESI takes care of cache-coherence.
M -> Modified
E -> Exclusive
S -> Shared
I -> Invalid

\fig{1}{FIGURE-SIZE}{MESI Transition states}{MESI.png}

AMD added O for Ownership and made it MOESI.

\subsection false sharing

int a = 0
int b = 0

   	  t1			  t2
	a = 1			b = 2
	for(...)		for(...)
	{ 			{
	... 			...
	a++ 			b++
	} 			}

The resultant values of a and b depend on wether they are in the same cache line or different.
If t2 is executed first followed by t1 and they are in the same cacheline then the copy of t1 is always discarded. This is called false sharing. This happens though the values of a and b are logically unshared but are physically shared. This can result in cache line pingponging.

To implement cache coherence Snoopy cache and Directory based protocols are used among other techniques.

\subsection Sequential V/s Concurrency
1: a=1
2: b =2
3. spawn f(a)
4. spawn g(b)
5. sync
6. print a

The flow diagram would be as  follows:

\fig{2}{FIGURE-SIZE}{Flow diagram}{seq_con.png}

Inst 3 and Inst 4 result in 2 threads but inst 5 results in merge of flow.

For synchronization in a "co-operative sync process" model we need atomic reads and writes. Atomic operation is defined as an indivisible operation based on the word size of the system.

If there are regions in code that should be accessed only by a single thread at a given time then the region is called critical region. Locks are used to ensure that only one thread executes in a critical region. 

Code to lock a resource would look as below:
	TEST\_AND\_SET(l)
	if (l == 0) {
		l = 1;
		return true;
		}
	return false;

So, a thread code for locking a resource would look like:
lock(l):
while (true) {
	r = TEST\_AND\_SET(l);
	if (r)
		return;
} // This mecahnism of locking is called Spin lock

or

lock(l):
while (true) {
	...
} 
sleep();
sched\_yield()

// This mechanism is called spin and block lock

To unlock all you do is reset 1 to 0, so, the code looks like:

unlock(l):
{
	l = 0;
}

\section D-threads
Removes race condition by updating the memory to global memory in a specific order. There are 2 ways of analysis : static and dynamic

\subsection Static Analysis
- It sees program instruction
- Reports lots of false alarms(cases where it detects race conditions but only a few are true)
- It has high coverage

\subsection Dynamic Analysis
- It has lower coverage
- Reports things that are only real
- It misses a lot of scenarios which can result on a different system/environment/load conditions

\section THE
- Introduced layered approach, which is currently used in networking stack. 
- This approach is called "Separation of concerns". 
- Advantages of layered approaches are:
	a) Easy to test things independently
	b) Composable
	c) Modular
- So, the system aproach went from Monolithic to layered approach.

Then came microkernels and the war between MINIX and LINUX.
